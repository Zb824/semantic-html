## Description
The Agency had a mostly fuctional website, but not accessible.  
I refactored the code to improve accessibility, the website is now more user friendly.


## Tasks
- Semantic refactoring
- Element restructuring
- Adding alt image attributes
- Correct heading sequence
- Creating title element
- Link functionality

## What I Learned   

- Semantics enhances our ability to interpret the content for the user. 

- Semantics can help reduce the number classes and ids required for the code to complete a task. 

- Even if code works, there is probably a more efficient way it can be written.
